# AI-Intelligent-Agent-Simulator

This project is a simulation environment showcasing five distinct types of intelligent agents commonly used in artificial intelligence systems. Each agent is implemented in Python and can be tested in different decision-making and performance scenarios.

## ðŸ§  Agent Types Implemented

1. **Simple Reflex Agent**
   - Stateless; reacts based only on current perception.
   - Fast and lightweight, but unable to learn or plan.

2. **Model-Based Reflex Agent**
   - Maintains internal state to represent the environment.
   - Suitable for partially observable environments.

3. **Goal-Based Agent**
   - Acts to achieve explicitly defined goals.
   - Capable of planning a sequence of actions.

4. **Utility-Based Agent**
   - Chooses actions to maximize a defined utility function.
   - Can manage trade-offs and uncertainty.

5. **Learning Agent**
   - Adapts behavior based on past performance.
   - Improves decision-making through experience.

## ðŸŽ® Features

- Visual simulation using `matplotlib`
- Performance metrics: response time, success rate, and effectiveness
- Interactive widgets to explore agent decisions
- Customizable grid-world environment
- Side-by-side agent behavior comparison
